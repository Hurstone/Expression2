# The E2 radio

The e2 radio is an E2 made to play songs in garry's mod you the radio support : dropbox and discord sharlinks.

## How to use 

To use the E2 you'll need to create a file named libraries you'll need to create it in the expression2 folder (it should look like this : Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\data\expression2\Librairies)
Or you can modify the code in the expression e2 by changing in line 10 the librairie folder name by yours (WARINNG THE LIBRAIRIE IS ESSENTIAL TO WORK IF IT'S NOT IMPORTED PROPELY IT WILL NOT WORK !)

Once you have the Radio in your game you'll just need to place it on a streamradio 

And you're basicly done !
