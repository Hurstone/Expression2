# The E2 radio

The e2 radio is an E2 made to play songs in garry's mod the radio supports : dropbox and discord sharelinks.

## How to use 

To use the E2 you will need to create a file named libraries under the expression2 folder (it should look like this : Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\data\expression2\Librairies)
Or you can modify the code in the expression2 by changing in line 10 the library folder name to yours (WARNING THE LIBRARY IS ESSENTIAL FOR OPERATION IF IT IS NOT IMPORTED PROPELY IT WILL NOT WORK !)

Once you have the Radio in your game you will just need to place it on a streamradio 

And you're basically done!
